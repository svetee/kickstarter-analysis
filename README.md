# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview

The data analysis was performed on kickstarter data to uncover trends to show results and trends on successful and failed kickstarted campaigns in several countries. Data was filtered for the US, GB and examples from the theater category. Categories vary in success as shown in the graph.

### Descriptive Data Theater Category

Data suggests that out of 912 theater plays, 525 were successful and 349 failed. To understand the reason behind the failure an analysis was conducted on project goals and pledged amounts.

Descriptive statistics for goals and pledged amounts, average donations and numbers of backers show that the mean goal for successful theater plays was $5,048 while failed plays aimed for almost double ($10,554). The mean pledge of successful plays was $5,601 while only $558 for failed projects. 

The data shows that, in addition to the needed funding, the launch date seems to be significant, since especially launching in the second quarter seems to be promissing for successful plays.

From the plot chart below, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
