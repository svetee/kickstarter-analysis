### Descriptive Data Theater Category

Data suggests that out of 912 theater plays, 525 were successful and 349 failed. To understand the reason behind the failure an analysis was conducted on project goals and pledged amounts.

Descriptive statistics for goals and pledged amounts, average donations and numbers of backers show that the mean goal for successful theater plays was $5,048 while failed plays aimed for almost double ($10,554). The mean pledge of successful plays was $5,601 while only $558 for failed projects. 

The data shows that, in addition to the needed funding, the launch date seems to be significant, since especially launching in the second quarter seems to be promissing for successful plays.

The data also suggests to keep the goal amount below US$ 2,000 when looking at the median of pledged amounts for plays in GB.
